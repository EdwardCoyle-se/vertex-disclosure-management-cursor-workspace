# Vertex UI Disclosure Management - Documents Panel Testing Plan

## Overview

This testing plan provides a focused, incremental approach to implementing tests for the vertex-ui-disclosure-management Angular application, **specifically targeting the documents panel functionality**. This plan prioritizes getting basic test coverage around the documents panel and its behavior with small, easily-saved implementation steps.

## Testing Infrastructure & Standards

### Current Setup

- **Testing Framework**: Jasmine + Karma (configured via vertex-ui-shared)
- **Coverage Tool**: karma-coverage
- **CI Integration**: karma-junit-reporter
- **Target Coverage**: >85% for frontend components (per Vertex standards)
- **Test Pattern**: Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA)

### Key Testing Principles from Vertex Documentation

- **Signal-based Testing**: Test Angular signals and computed values
- **Component Architecture**: Test standalone components with proper imports
- **Service Testing**: Mock dependencies and test both success/error scenarios
- **Integration Testing**: Include vertex-ui-shared components directly in tests
- **Incremental Coverage**: Start with basic functionality, build up over time

### Testing Focus & Scope

**üéØ Primary Focus**: Documents Panel functionality and related components
**üìà Coverage Strategy**: Incremental - basic coverage first, comprehensive later
**üîß Integration Approach**: Include vertex-ui-shared components directly (no mocking)
**‚ôø Accessibility**: Functional tests first, axe-core accessibility testing to be added later

## Testing Categories & Priorities

## üéØ Documents Panel Testing - Core Focus

### Step 1: Documents Panel Component (`documents-panel.component.ts`)

**Implementation Priority**: Start here - Core business functionality
**Complexity**: High - File operations, table management, dialog interactions
**Testing Strategy**: Incremental - basic functionality first, edge cases later

#### Phase 1A: Basic Component Setup & Initialization (Start Here)

  - [ ] Component renders without errors with required inputs
  - [ ] Default signal values are set properly (documents, isLoading, error)
  - [ ] Effect for loading documents triggers on reportId change
  - [ ] Component integrates with vertex-ui-shared table component

#### Phase 1B: Document Loading & Service Integration

- [ ] **Document Loading & Display**
  - [ ] `loadDocuments()` calls DocumentService correctly with reportId
  - [ ] Loading state management during API calls (isLoading signal)
  - [ ] Error handling for failed document loads (error signal)
  - [ ] Documents list populated in table correctly
  - [ ] Empty state displayed when no documents exist

#### Phase 1C: Basic File Operations

## üìè Testing Standards & Patterns

### Test File Structure

```text
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [component-folder]/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ component.ts
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ component.html
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ component.css
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ component.spec.ts    # ‚Üê Test file here
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ service.ts
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ service.spec.ts      # ‚Üê Test file here
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ testing/             # ‚Üê Shared test utilities
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test-helpers.ts
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mock-factories.ts
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test-data.ts
```

### Test Naming Conventions

- **Test files**: `*.spec.ts`
- **Test suites**: Describe component/service name
- **Test cases**: Use clear, behavior-focused descriptions
- **Mock objects**: Prefix with `mock` or `stub`

### Test Structure Pattern

```typescript
describe('ComponentName', () => {
  let component: ComponentName;
  let fixture: ComponentFixture<ComponentName>;
  let mockService: jasmine.SpyObj<ServiceName>;

  beforeEach(async () => {
    // Setup TestBed configuration
    // Create component fixture
    // Setup mocks and spies
  });

  describe('Component Creation', () => {
    it('should create', () => {
      expect(component).toBeTruthy();
    });
  });

  describe('Feature Group', () => {
    it('should behave correctly when...', () => {
      // Arrange
      // Act  
      // Assert
    });
  });
});
```

### Mock Strategies

- **Services**: Use `jasmine.createSpyObj()` for service mocks (DocumentService, BffService)
- **HTTP**: Use Angular's `HttpTestingController` for service testing
- **Signals**: Create mock signals with `signal()` for testing
- **vertex-ui-shared**: **Include directly** (do not mock) for integration testing

### Coverage Requirements

- **Initial Goal**: Basic functional coverage for documents panel
- **Long-term Target**: 85% per Vertex standards (future enhancement)
- **Focus Areas**: Core document operations and user workflows
- **Approach**: Incremental coverage improvement over time

## üîç Accessibility Testing (Future Implementation)

**üìù Note**: Accessibility testing with axe-core is planned for future implementation after functional test coverage is established.

**Future Accessibility Testing Requirements**:

- [ ] Configure `@storybook/addon-a11y` for real-time testing
- [ ] Add axe-core testing in unit tests
- [ ] ESLint accessibility rules enforcement
- [ ] Keyboard navigation testing for document operations
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility testing
- [ ] Focus management testing for dialogs

## üìä Success Metrics

### Quantitative Targets

- [ ] **Initial Coverage**: Basic functional coverage for documents panel components
- [ ] **Test Performance**: Document panel tests complete in <10 seconds
- [ ] **Test Reliability**: Tests run consistently without flakiness
- [ ] **CI Integration**: New tests integrate with existing CI/CD pipeline

### Qualitative Targets
