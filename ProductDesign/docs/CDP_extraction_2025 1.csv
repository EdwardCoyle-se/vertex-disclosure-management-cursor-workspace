They will likely have key knowledge and expertise to share with existing initiatives and be able to progress shared goals effectively. Investors and other data users are interested in knowing how organizations identify collaborations that maximize value and positive impact. Prioritizing a landscape should go beyond a country/area level analysis to the regions within a value chain that pose the highest risk from deforestation and conversion. It will also identify landscapes that present opportunities for collaboration, such as governmental commitments and the presence of existing initiatives, including for production, conservation, and restoration activities. This requires an understanding of the overlay between footprint and risk/opportunity within these production landscapes. It is critical that organizations establish a definition for the priority landscapes within their sourcing footprint, and a set of criteria for choosing which landscape to engage in - such as a risk of non-compliance with sourcing policies or the presence of conditions that foster meaningful engagement. This ensures that the engagement and type of intervention integrates with the organization's sustainability strategy and risk assessment approach.
