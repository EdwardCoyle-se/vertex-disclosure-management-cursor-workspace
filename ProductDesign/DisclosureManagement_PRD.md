### **Disclosure Management PRD**

**Domain Identification for Technical Implementation:**
*   **Domain Name:** `disclosure-management`
*   **Project Names:** `vertex-disclosure-management-ui, vertex-bff-disclosure-management, vertex-disclosure-management-api`

### **1. Background**

**1.1. Problem Statement**
The ESG ecosystem does not contain the ability to fully complete a disclosure report (RFI). Organizations have primarily focused on the capture of data into Indicator Management, solving only one-third of the disclosure reporting problem. ESG professionals lack a comprehensive platform to create complete disclosure reports that utilize existing sustainability data while allowing completion of disclosure elements not covered by indicator management systems. This gap is causing lost sales opportunities and preventing users from conducting full disclosure reporting, limiting the effectiveness of sustainability programs.

**1.2. Market Opportunity**
The ESG disclosure management market is experiencing rapid growth driven by increasing regulatory requirements (CSRD/ESRS, SEC Climate Rule) and stakeholder demands for transparency. Organizations require comprehensive platforms that cover the full disclosure reporting lifecycle, not just data collection. Current solutions focus heavily on data capture but lack the ability to produce complete, framework-compliant disclosure reports. The market opportunity includes:
- Growing demand for comprehensive ESG disclosure solutions covering 2/3rds of major requirements
- Regulatory compliance for multiple frameworks (CDP, CSRD/ESRS, SEC Climate Rule)
- Integration with existing sustainability data management systems
- Export capabilities for various disclosure formats and standards

Key competitors focus primarily on data collection or basic questionnaire tools but lack the comprehensive approach that combines data reuse, flexible disclosure completion, and professional-grade export capabilities that Disclosure Management provides.

**1.3. User Personas**

*   **Persona 1: ESG Manager**
    *   **Characteristics:** Mid-level sustainability professional with 3-5 years experience, manages multiple disclosure frameworks simultaneously, technically proficient with ESG software platforms, works under tight regulatory deadlines.
    *   **Needs:** Efficient workflow to create and manage multiple disclosure reports, ability to reuse data from indicator management systems, collaboration tools for team-based reporting, progress tracking and deadline management.
    *   **Challenges:** Currently manages disclosure reporting across multiple disconnected tools, struggles with data consistency across frameworks, lacks visibility into completion status and team progress.

*   **Persona 2: Sustainability Consultant**
    *   **Characteristics:** External advisor working with multiple organizations on disclosure compliance, expert-level knowledge of frameworks like CDP, CSRD, SEC Climate Rule, requires flexible tools that adapt to different client needs.
    *   **Needs:** Professional-grade disclosure authoring capabilities, ability to work efficiently across multiple client frameworks, export capabilities for various submission formats, template and reusability features.
    *   **Challenges:** Spends excessive time on manual report compilation, struggles with inconsistent data formats across clients, needs efficient ways to leverage previous work and templates.

*   **Persona 3: Corporate Sustainability Director**
    *   **Characteristics:** Senior executive responsible for overall sustainability strategy and reporting, focuses on high-level oversight and stakeholder communication, requires executive dashboards and summary reporting.
    *   **Needs:** High-level visibility into disclosure completion status, ability to track organizational compliance across multiple frameworks, summary reporting for executive teams and board communications.
    *   **Challenges:** Lacks visibility into detailed disclosure progress, struggles to communicate sustainability program effectiveness to senior leadership, needs consolidated view of compliance status.

### **2. Vision & Strategy**

**2.1. Vision Statement**
To become the comprehensive platform that closes the disclosure reporting gap in ESG management by enabling organizations to efficiently create complete, framework-compliant disclosure reports that seamlessly integrate existing sustainability data with flexible authoring capabilities for comprehensive compliance.

**2.2. Product Origin**
The Disclosure Management concept emerged from the recognition that existing Indicator Management solutions, while effective for data collection, only addressed one-third of the disclosure reporting challenge. Organizations consistently requested capabilities to complete full disclosure reports, particularly for regulatory frameworks like CDP, CSRD/ESRS, and SEC Climate Rule. The platform was conceived to bridge this gap by building upon existing data collection infrastructure while adding comprehensive disclosure authoring and collaboration capabilities.

**2.3. Strategic Alignment**
Disclosure Management aligns with the broader Vertex sustainability platform strategy by:
- Complementing Indicator Management to provide end-to-end sustainability data lifecycle management
- Supporting regulatory compliance initiatives that drive market demand for ESG solutions
- Creating synergies with existing platform components through data integration and shared infrastructure
- Positioning the platform as a comprehensive solution covering both data collection and disclosure reporting requirements
