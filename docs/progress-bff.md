## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Key Decisions
- **Data Aggregation**: Combine framework metadata, version counts, and disclosure statistics from multiple Core API calls into single dashboard responses
- **Hierarchy Building**: Transform flat disclosure data into nested tree structures optimized for UI tree components
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache framework summaries for 15 minutes, hierarchy data for 30 minutes, with cache invalidation on updates
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when Core API is unavailable, return cached data with staleness indicators
- **Document Storage Architecture (NEW)**: **VertexAtlas.Data as Single Source of Truth** - Eliminated local document metadata storage in Core API, BFF now queries VertexAtlas.Data directly with comprehensive metadata JSON storage

### Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: Building efficient disclosure hierarchies from potentially large datasets
  - **Solution**: Implement server-side tree building with lazy loading support and client-side expansion state management
- **Challenge**: Organizational data filtering without exposing unauthorized data
  - **Solution**: Extract organization claims from JWT and apply filtering at BFF level as additional security layer
- **Challenge**: Framework comparison complexity with large version differences
  - **Solution**: Implement server-side diff algorithm with categorized changes (added/modified/removed)
- **Challenge (NEW)**: Document metadata consistency across multiple services
  - **Solution**: Eliminated data duplication by using VertexAtlas.Data as single source of truth, with BFF handling temporary filtering logic until Atlas API supports metadata filtering

### Frontend Requirements
- **Dashboard Data**: Framework counts by organization, recent updates, top frameworks by usage
- **Search Capabilities**: Full-text search across framework names and descriptions with faceted filtering
- **Hierarchy Display**: Lazy-loaded tree component with search within hierarchy
- **Version Comparison**: Side-by-side comparison with visual change indicators
- **Performance Needs**: Dashboard loads under 500ms, hierarchy expansion under 200ms

## 🔗 Dependencies & Integration

### Core API Dependencies
- vertex-frameworks-api must be deployed and accessible
- All Core API endpoints documented with OpenAPI specification
- JWT authentication properly configured for service-to-service communication
- Health checks available for dependency monitoring

### Refit Configuration
```csharp
public interface IFrameworksCoreApi
{
    [Get("/api/frameworks")]
    Task<IEnumerable<FrameworkSummary>> GetFrameworksAsync([Query] string? organizationId = null);
    
    [Get("/api/frameworks/{id}")]
    Task<FrameworkDetail> GetFrameworkAsync(string id);
    
    [Get("/api/frameworks/{id}/versions/{versionId}/hierarchy")]
    Task<IEnumerable<DisclosureNodeVersion>> GetHierarchyAsync(string id, string versionId);
    
    [Post("/api/frameworks")]
    Task<FrameworkDetail> CreateFrameworkAsync([Body] CreateFrameworkCommand command);
    
    [Post("/api/frameworks/search")]
    Task<SearchResult<FrameworkSummary>> SearchFrameworksAsync([Body] SearchFrameworksQuery query);
    
    [Get("/api/frameworks/{id}/versions/compare")]
    Task<FrameworkComparison> CompareVersionsAsync(string id, string fromVersion, string toVersion);
}
```

### Data Flow
1. **Frontend Request** → BFF Controller (with JWT token)
2. **BFF Controller** → Extract user context and organization claims
3. **BFF Controller** → Core API calls via Refit (with token forwarding)
4. **Core API Response** → BFF data transformation and aggregation
5. **Transformed Data** → Frontend with UI-optimized structure

### Authentication Flow
1. **Frontend** → Sends JWT token to BFF
2. **BFF** → Validates token and extracts organization claims
3. **BFF** → Forwards token to Core API calls
4. **Core API** → Validates token and applies organizational filtering
5. **BFF** → Additional filtering and transformation based on user context

## 🚀 Next Steps
1. **Complete BFF implementation** with all data transformation logic
2. **Integration testing with Core API** including error scenarios
3. **Deploy to development environment** with monitoring
4. **Begin Frontend development** using BFF API contracts
5. **End-to-end testing** with realistic user scenarios
6. **Performance optimization** based on frontend usage patterns
