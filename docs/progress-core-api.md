- [ ] 🚧 Load testing for concurrent user scenarios
- [ ] 🚧 Add tests for advanced export and integration workflows

### Phase 7: Document Management Architecture Cleanup (NEW) 
- [ ] 📋 **Remove ReportDocument Infrastructure** - Delete entities, repositories, handlers, and controllers (no longer needed)
- [ ] 📋 **Update QuestionDocuments Schema** - Remove Report_Document_Id FK, add direct Atlas_Document_Id field
- [ ] 📋 **Database Migration** - Drop Report_Documents table, modify Question_Documents structure
- [ ] 📋 **Update AI Integration** - Modify AI answer handlers to use Atlas document IDs directly
- [ ] 📋 **Cleanup DTOs and Models** - Remove ReportDocument-related request/response classes
- [ ] 📋 **Add QuestionDocument Cleanup Logic** - Handle orphaned records when Atlas documents are deleted

### Phase 8: Deployment & Documentation
- [ ] 📋 Configure Azure DevOps CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] 📋 Set up environment-specific configurations (dev, staging, prod)
- [ ] 📋 Configure Application Insights for monitoring and logging
- [ ] 📋 Update OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- [ ] 📋 Create deployment runbook with rollback procedures
- [ ] 📋 Conduct final testing in staging environment
- [ ] 📋 Create API usage documentation for BFF service integration

## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Key Decisions
- **Database Schema**: Using stable identifiers (Framework.Id, DisclosureId) with separate versioned entities for temporal data
- **Hierarchy Management**: Adjacency list pattern on DisclosureNodeVersion with ParentDisclosureId for N-level nesting
- **Organizational Isolation**: Framework-level tenancy via OrganizationId with query filters from JWT claims
- **Versioning Strategy**: Monotonic VersionOrder with revision support (IsPublished flag for draft/published workflow)
- **Data Types**: Normalized categories (Narrative, Quantitative, etc.) with raw source type preservation
- **Document Storage Architecture (NEW)**: **Eliminated Local Document Storage** - BFF now manages VertexAtlas.Data integration directly, Core API only maintains AI question-document relationships via QuestionDocuments table

### Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: Complex hierarchy queries with performance concerns
  - **Solution**: Implement recursive CTEs for hierarchy loading with caching for frequently accessed trees
- **Challenge**: CSV import with large datasets and validation
  - **Solution**: Streaming processing with batch validation and transaction management for rollback capability
- **Challenge**: Multi-tenant data isolation without performance impact
  - **Solution**: Global filters in EF Core context with organization claim extraction from JWT

### Code Review Items
- [ ] All CQRS handlers follow established Vertex patterns with MediatR
- [ ] Proper error handling with structured logging and correlation IDs
- [ ] Comprehensive validation rules for all business operations
- [ ] API documentation includes examples and error scenarios
- [ ] Security considerations: JWT validation, organizational filtering, input sanitization
- [ ] Performance: query optimization, caching strategies, pagination support
- [ ] ResourceId format consistency across all entities (fw_xxx_guid)

## 🔗 Dependencies & Integration

### Database Dependencies
- SQL Server instance configured with appropriate collation
- DbUp migration tool set up for version-controlled schema changes
- Entity Framework Core 8.0 with audit interceptors configured

### External Integrations
- [ ] Azure Service Bus for framework update notifications
- [ ] Application Insights for telemetry and monitoring
- [ ] Azure Blob Storage for CSV file processing and temporary storage

### API Versioning
- Using date-based versioning: `2025-07-17`
- Swagger documentation grouped by version
- Backward compatibility maintained for at least 12 months

## 🚀 Next Steps
1. **Complete Core API implementation** with full CRUD operations and business logic
2. **Deploy to development environment** with CI/CD pipeline
3. **Begin BFF service development** (depends on this service's APIs)
4. **Integration testing with BFF** using Refit interfaces
5. **Load testing** with realistic framework data volumes
