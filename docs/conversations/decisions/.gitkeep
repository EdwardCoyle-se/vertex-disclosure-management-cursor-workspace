# Architecture & Design Decisions

This directory contains documentation of significant decisions made during conversations.

These complement the formal ADRs in `/docs/adr/` by capturing:
- Informal design discussions
- Implementation approach decisions
- Tool and technology choices
- Patterns and conventions established

Examples:
- `2024-10-14-component-hierarchy-decision.md`
- `2024-10-15-data-flow-patterns.md`
