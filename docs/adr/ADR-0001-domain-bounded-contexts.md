### **ADR-0001-domain-bounded-contexts**

**Title:** Domain Bounded Contexts and Service Responsibilities

---

### **1. Status**

**Status:** Approved

**Date:** 2025-01-17

**Decision Makers:** Tech Lead, Solution Architect, Product Owner

---

### **2. Context**

**2.1. Background**
The Disclosure Management platform requires clear separation of responsibilities across the three-tier Vertex architecture to ensure maintainability, scalability, and alignment with Domain-Driven Design principles. With multiple complex domains (frameworks, reports, answers, file management), we need to establish clear boundaries for service responsibilities.

**2.2. Problem Statement**
Without clearly defined bounded contexts and service responsibilities, the system risks becoming a distributed monolith with unclear ownership, making it difficult to maintain, scale, and evolve independently.

**2.3. Constraints & Requirements**
- **Technical Constraints:** Must align with Vertex three-tier architecture (UI → BFF → Core API)
- **Business Constraints:** Must support organizational multi-tenancy and regulatory compliance requirements
- **Architectural Constraints:** Must leverage vertex-dotnet-api-sdk patterns and Clean Architecture principles

**2.4. Stakeholders**
- **Primary:** Development team, Solution Architect, Tech Lead
- **Secondary:** Product Owner, DevOps team, Future development teams

### **3. Decision**

**3.1. Decision Statement**
Implement a clear separation of bounded contexts with the Core API owning pure domain logic and CRUD operations, the BFF service handling UI-specific data aggregation and transformation, and the Angular frontend managing user experience and client-side state.

**3.2. Solution Overview**
- **Technology Stack:** Vertex standard stack with .NET 8, Angular 20+, SQL Server
- **Architecture Pattern:** Clean Architecture with CQRS, Domain-Driven Design bounded contexts
- **Implementation Approach:** Vertical slice architecture within bounded contexts
- **Integration Points:** RESTful APIs between tiers, MediatR for internal communication

**3.3. Technical Specifications**
- **Core API Bounded Contexts:**
  - Framework Management: Framework import, versioning, question hierarchies
  - Report Lifecycle: Report creation, status management, workflow orchestration
  - Answer Management: Answer validation, data integration, version tracking
  - File Management: Attachment handling, metadata tracking, storage coordination
- **BFF Service Responsibilities:**
  - Dashboard aggregations (completion statistics, health metrics)
  - User-specific data filtering and transformation
  - Multi-service integration orchestration
  - UI-optimized data structures
- **Frontend Domain Organization:**
  - Feature-based module structure (dashboard, frameworks, reports, workspace)
  - Service layer for API communication
  - State management for user session and workflow state
- **Resource ID Strategy:** VARCHAR(54) format `dm_<assetType>_<guid>` for all entities
- **Database Strategy:** Single database with clear table ownership per bounded context

### **4. Reasoning**

**4.1. Evaluation Criteria**
- **Maintainability:** Clear ownership and minimal coupling between contexts
- **Scalability:** Independent evolution and deployment capabilities
- **Developer Experience:** Clear mental models and predictable patterns
- **Business Alignment:** Contexts align with business processes and user workflows

**4.2. Key Decision Factors**
- Vertex platform consistency requires adherence to established three-tier patterns
- Regulatory compliance needs clear audit trails and data lineage
- Team productivity benefits from clear context boundaries
- Future extensibility requires loosely coupled domain boundaries

**4.3. Trade-offs Accepted**
- Slight increase in initial development complexity for long-term maintainability gains
- Potential data duplication across contexts for performance optimization
- Additional abstraction layers may impact initial development velocity

---

### **5. Alternatives Considered**

**5.1. Alternative 1: Monolithic Core Service**
- **Description:** Single large service handling all domain logic
- **Pros:** Simpler initial development, easier cross-domain transactions
- **Cons:** Poor scalability, unclear ownership, difficult to maintain
- **Rejection Reason:** Conflicts with Vertex architectural principles and long-term maintainability goals

**5.2. Alternative 2: Microservices Architecture**
- **Description:** Separate services for each bounded context
- **Pros:** Maximum independence, technology diversity
- **Cons:** Excessive complexity for domain size, network overhead, transaction complexity
- **Rejection Reason:** Over-engineering for current scale and Vertex platform patterns

### **6. Consequences**

**6.1. Positive Consequences**
- **Technical Benefits:** Clear separation of concerns, improved testability, independent evolution capabilities
- **Business Benefits:** Faster feature development, reduced risk of changes, better alignment with business processes
- **Team Benefits:** Clear ownership boundaries, reduced cognitive load, improved developer onboarding

**6.2. Negative Consequences**
- **Technical Debt:** Additional abstraction layers may require more comprehensive documentation
- **Operational Overhead:** Multiple service endpoints require coordination for deployment and monitoring
- **Learning Curve:** Team members need to understand bounded context principles and responsibilities

**6.3. Risk Mitigation**
- Comprehensive documentation of context boundaries and responsibilities
- Clear API contracts between services with versioning strategy
- Regular architecture reviews to prevent context boundary violations

### **7. Implementation Plan**

**7.1. Implementation Phases**
- **Phase 1:** Establish Core API bounded contexts with clear entity ownership
- **Phase 2:** Implement BFF service with aggregation and transformation logic
- **Phase 3:** Organize frontend modules aligned with domain contexts

**7.2. Dependencies**
- **Technical Dependencies:** Vertex platform infrastructure, authentication services
- **Team Dependencies:** Architecture training for development team
- **External Dependencies:** Database schema design approval

**7.3. Success Criteria**
- **Technical Metrics:** <200ms API response times, >90% test coverage per context
- **Business Metrics:** Reduced cross-team dependencies, faster feature delivery

**7.4. Rollback Plan**
- Consolidation strategy available if context boundaries prove problematic
- Database schema designed to support both approaches initially

---

### **8. Monitoring & Review**

**8.1. Monitoring Strategy**
- **Key Metrics:** API response times per context, error rates by bounded context, cross-context dependencies
- **Monitoring Tools:** Application Insights, custom dashboards for context health
- **Alert Thresholds:** >500ms response times, >1% error rates per context

**8.2. Review Schedule**
- **Short-term Review:** 3 months post-implementation for boundary effectiveness
- **Long-term Review:** Annual review during major version planning
- **Trigger Events:** Performance issues, frequent cross-context changes, team feedback
